in mid 2023 i started learning more deeply into excel and VBA, i'm still much of a beginners but i've made some great work imo, especially in that Lave-Train VBA file, last time i worked on that it broke,
 i posted it here maybe with the bugs with it idk i havn't checked before, but nothing i can't fix
 i even think i fixed that one bug i'm talking about, came back, and idk if i reverted back to a backup or fixed it / left it
